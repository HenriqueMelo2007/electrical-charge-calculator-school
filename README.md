# Electrical Load Calculator
This project is a simple calculator in C language that allows you to calculate the total electrical charge of a body or the number of electrons lost or received, based on electrostatic formulas.

## Functionalities

### Calculation of Electrical Charge (Q)
The calculator allows you to determine the value of the total electrical charge of a body (Q) using the following formula:

```Q = N * E```

Where:

- Q is a total electrical charge.
- N is the number of electrons lost or recovered.
- E is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^-19 Coulombs).

### Calculation of the Number of Electrons (N)
Furthermore, it is possible to calculate the number of electrons lost or received (N) using the following formula:

```N = Q / E```

Where:

- N is the number of electrons.
- Q is a total electrical charge.
- E is the elementary charge (1.6 x 10^19 Coulombs).
